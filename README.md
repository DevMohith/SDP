Task - Library Management System

Students and faculty can borrow books with varying limits and durations. Each book will have a unique ID, even for multiple copies of the same title by the same author. The system will record all book entries, including details of who borrows a book, when it was borrowed, and the borrowing duration. It will also track fines for late returns. Books can be acquired through purchase, donation, or on-loan (with a set time period). Certain books may have restrictions on being removed from the library, resulting in shorter borrowing durations (less than a day), but multiple reservations can be made simultaneously. This setup is typical for a university library.
